This is a special verion of https://github.com/x1a7x/RUST-SIMPLE-IMAGEBOARD-1  and its a bit deal. Why? Well take a good look at all the imageboards coded in rust currently on git. Not a single one of them has a codebase so small as this one is, and not a single one of them are as easy to install as this one is.
